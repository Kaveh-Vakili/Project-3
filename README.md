# Project-3

Week 1:
Theodore Melcher is my partner

Week 2:
I created a readFile where in this function I open the userlog file. Once I opened the file, I used the .read method to read the file and print all the conent of the file to the screen. This function is a good beginning to the project, as it gives me the ability to see what is consisted within this function.
