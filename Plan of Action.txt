I this project I will most likely begin with creating 5 functions.The first function called Suspicious activities would be created in order to iterate over the number of times suspicious activities occurred through a given range. For the next function called Irresponsible behavior, this is where I would check using conditionals if the user forgot to logout. There I would mark as irresponsible behavior. The third function is the system glitch function where count the number of times the system glitches. There you would count the total glitches and if not mathematically possible, take awareness to that.The system will record the number of glitches per user. And finally, the last function which is the domain count is where the user enters specific information of email,name, and domain name within the account and record it.
